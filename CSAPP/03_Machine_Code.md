1. The primary difference between executing a 32-bit program and a 64-bit program on a 64-bit operating system lies in the **size of memory pointers** and the **register usage convention**. Explain how the choice of 32-bit or 64-bit compilation for a program (not the OS) impacts both its **maximum addressable heap/stack space** and the **efficiency of function calls** due to the number of general-purpose registers available.
